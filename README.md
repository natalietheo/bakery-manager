## About the Project

This project was created with a view of automating some of the manual processes that are involved in running a bakery. This bakery management system allows a customer to sign-up, login, and place orders. Customers can also view their own profile page that lists all their orders.

Similarly for the admin users who can view their own profile, view all orders sent to them organised by date: soonest to latest, as well as add new stock and edit their current stock.

## The process behind creating Bakery Manager
###### And how it came to be what it is now

We first began by creating an extensive Excalidraw,
really getting into the depths of what we what the design to be,
how it will function and interact with other pages of the website.

###### *This is what it looked like on the final day of implementing features!!*

Alongside this, we used a trello to truly keep track of where we were with implementing features and testing.

Both of these helped us keep track of where we were in the development process, and by assigning ourselves to tickets on the trello it also made
it visable what we were working on.

*Which is super important for communication!*

## Nearing the end of the project
###### As with everything, it came down to a time crunch.

On the last Wednesday we were trying to pull together the last few strings (and squash any bugs) needed to make our project whole and completely functioning. We also thought about getting it deployed, going off of what a Makers alumni used on their final project, to really bring it to life for others to use!

To make sure we knew what areas to focus on we created two new columns in trello (to do today, and clean up): this made it super easy to get our heads down and finish feeling satisfied.
